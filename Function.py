n = int(input())
for i in range(1, n+1):
        print(i, end="")

#within the for loop statement I am telling the code to get a range of numbers that start at 1
#and ends at the n input plus 1. Although the n+1 is not to be included within the code. 

#In the print statement I am telling the program to print the iterations of i and I use the end="" parameter
#to make sure that all of the numbers are on the same line when outputted.
